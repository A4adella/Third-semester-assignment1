## Overview
This project is an interactive card details form built with React and styled using CSS. Users can input their card information—including name, card number, expiry date, and CVC—and see a live preview of the card as they type. After submitting valid details, a "Thank You" screen is displayed, confirming successful entry.


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

## My process

- The project was developed using React functional components and TypeScript for type safety.

- It was split  into reusable components like CardDisplay, InputForm, and CompletedState.

- Controlled inputs were used for managing form data and validation errors.

- Implemented live updates on the card preview as users filled out the form.

- The CompletedState component allowed users to reset the form and start again.

- Used npm run build and npm run preview to test and deploy a production-ready version of the app.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vite.dev)
